# Tofu

### What is this?
This is an attempt by me to make a font that is just a box with the unicode code point inside. These are usually not in a font but rather programmatically generated by programs as they encounter characters that have no associated glyph.

### Why?
Because I wanted zero width characters in my code to be not zero width. I was trying out vss code (pretty nice imo) and found I should be able to use some CSS magic to make it so that certain characters are displayed by this font. ([see also](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/95687/making-a-tofu-font))

### Things that need to get fixed
 * It's not very readable when small. Make better tofu template
 * Fontforge python lib is sometimes screwy. Find better library

### This is stupid
Yeah probably, but for its very specific use case its not terribly bad.

### Generating a font
**WARNING**: PLEASE DO NOT RUN THIS CODE ON A HARD DRIVE, IM NOT SURE HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE. I USED A RAM DISK

The syntax for the program is as follows. `gen_tofu.py 0000 FFFD -o`
`0000` is the start
`FFFD` is the end
`-o` makes it output otf rather than ttf (should make this default, ttf screws up more in fontforge than otf)

### License
MIT, not sure if the font needs a special license. â–¯
